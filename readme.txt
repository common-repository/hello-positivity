Created for those of us who need a mental boost now and again.

== Description ==
= Be positive! =

Inspired by ‘Hello Dolly’, the legendary demo plugin that is part of WordPress culture. This plugin will randomly display a positive and inspirational thought in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.

If you don’t want a plugin that doesn't add any real functionality to your website and won’t be of any benefit to your visitors, then you shouldn’t install this. But if you think you could benefit from a small mental shove in the right direction when life is getting you down, this plugin might help.

== Installation ==
1. Upload “hello-positivity” folder to the “/wp-content/plugins/” directory
2. Activate the plugin through the “Plugins” menu in WordPress
